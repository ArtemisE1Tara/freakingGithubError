                <br>

                <h2>Logging by Oculus</h2>
                If you use pages such as <a href="tools/Oculus/AppVersions.html">AppVersions</a> Oculus API is being used to gather most of the data.
                <br>
                This data will log the same basic things mentioned in the <code>Logging by GitHub pages</code> section at the top.
                <br>
                Oculus privacy policy can be found <a href="https://www.oculus.com/legal/privacy-policy/">here</a>.
                <br>
                Due to programming reasons the requests gets proxied (more or less like telling someone to say something to someone else) through <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> which again logs the same things outlined in <code>Logging by GitHub pages</code>.
                <h2>Logging by YouTube</h2>
