                <h1>MORE INFO</h1>
                As you all have probably became aware of, Beat Games no longer owns the
                rights to the Beat Saber videogame or Beat Saber related products. As
                Meta now COMPLETELY owns the Beat Saber IP.
                <h2>WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?</h2>
                It means you get more of the game that you love! We understand that changes
                can be scary, but Meta has ensured to listen to every single word spoken by
                the Beat Saber community. Below is a list of the new awesome changes that are
                coming to Beat Saber!
                <ul>
                    <li>The game is now exclusive to Meta products.</li>
                    <li>A whole new game!</li>
                    <li>An even bigger community!</li>
                    <li>Even more updates!</li>
                    <li>New graphics</li>
                    <li>Completely new features which can be seen listed below!</li>
                </ul>

                <h1>NEW FEATURES</h1>
                <h2>Easy Anti Cheat</h2>
                Implementing EAC should've been something that had been done years ago,
                and we sincerely apologize. As other popular VR games have been
                implementing EAC into their games, it about time we do as well. Goodbye
                cheaters!

                <h2>Beat Sage</h2>
                We know you Meta Quest users have been wanting custom songs for quite a
                long while... so here it is! With this new feature, make any map you want, with
                the click of a button! This feature will completely replace normal custom songs,
                as they are now obsolete.

                optionally purchasable items into the game. We hope you enjoy the new
                content!
